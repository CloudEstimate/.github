# CloudEstimate

Welcome to **CloudEstimate**—an open-source tool designed to help you estimate annual cloud costs for self-hosted software across major cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure.

## What Does CloudEstimate Do?

Whether you're running GitLab, Ubuntu, or any other software on VMs, CloudEstimate lets you quickly see how much your cloud infrastructure could cost based on different workloads and activity levels. We pull pricing data for compute and storage resources, helping you make informed decisions when managing cloud environments.

## Why Open Source?

I created CloudEstimate with the open-source community in mind—because we all benefit from shared knowledge. It's built to be simple, transparent, and open to contributions. Whether you're adding new software configurations, improving the data model, or refining the cost estimates, your input matters here.

## How to Contribute
